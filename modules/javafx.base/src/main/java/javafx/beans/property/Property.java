     * While it is not possible for a property to be bound by more than one unidirectional binding,

     * Both properties of a bidirectional binding <em>weakly</em> reference their counterparts.
     * This is different from a unidirectional binding, where the target property <em>strongly</em>
     * references its binding source. In practice, this means that if any of the bidirectionally
     * bound properties become unreachable, the binding is eligible for garbage collection.
     * Furthermore, neither of the bidirectionally bound properties will keep its counterpart
     * alive if the counterpart would otherwise become unreachable.
